# Setup
There are two parts to this setup,
1. Azure Setup
2. Raspberry Pi Setup 

## 1. Setting up Azure

* ## Prerequisites
  * An installed and configured Azure CLI

* ### Deployment
  This setup can deployed on either __Windows Environment__ (using `setup.bat`) or __Linux Environment__ (using `setup.sh`).
  
    > __*Note*__  
    > The setup file creates a new Resource group and then deploys the Resources to it. The Following resources are created:
    > 1. Service Bus Namespace
    > 2. Service Bus Queue
    > 3. IoT Hub
    > 4. Logic App 
    > 5. Logic App Connectors
  
  1. Open a **terminal** and login to Azure using `az login` command.
  
  2. Depending on the environment you are using, run the following command:  
      * ##### In Windows Environment
        In command prompt run ```setup.bat```
        ###### Example:
        ```
          >setup.bat
          Starting...
          Enter resource group name: <Insert Resource Group Name>
        ```
      * ##### In Linux Environment
        In terminal run ```setup.sh```
        ###### Example:
        ```
          $setup.sh
          Starting...
          Enter resource group name: <Insert Resource Group Name>
        ```
     This creates a Resource Group in `eastus` and deploys `azure.ProximityAlert-Infra-deploy.json` ARM template in the same Resource Group.
     
  3. An **IoT Device** needs to be created. To do this, in the **Azure Portal**, navigate to the Resource Group created in the previous step.  
  4. Open the **IoT Hub** service.
  5. Click on **IoT devices** under **Explorers**.        
  6. Click on **+New** to add a new IoT device.
  7. Enter a name for your device under **Device ID** and leave other settings as it is.

  8. Click on **Save** to save your settings.
  9. After the deployment is complete, Click on your device name under **Device ID** in the IoT Hub page. 
  10. Copy the **Primary Connection String**.  

  

## 2. Setting up Raspberry Pi

* #### Before you get started
  For this setup you need a preconfigured Raspberry Pi with an OS (of your choice) and Python 3 installed. 
  > __*Note*__: This setup was tested with _**Raspberry Pi OS (Raspbian)**_ which has Python 3 pre-installed.

* #### Making the connections
   A HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor Module is used to sense the presence of a vehicle in its proximity. Construct the circuit as shown below.
   
   ![raspberry-pi-hc-sr04-distance-measuring-sensor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59735375/120596889-ec48d500-c461-11eb-96da-7298508035dc.jpg)
   
   ###Explain gpio setup###
  
* #### Inside the Pi
   * Now, after the connections are done, power up your Raspberry Pi. 
   * Open a **Terminal** and create a new directory `Proximity-Alert`
   * Next, We have to install an Azure IoT Package. Inside the newly created directory, run the following command.  
     `sudo pip3 install azure-iot-device`
   * Create a Python file **ProximityAlert_D2C.py** and paste in the following code to setup a Device to Cloud connection. *[How does this code work?](Design.md#Flowchart)*
     > This code reads input from the Ultrasonic sensor module through GPIO Pins, then forms a connection between Raspberry Pi and Azure IoT Hub and transmits the recieved input to Azure.
       ```

           print("IoT Hub Quickstart ")
           print("ctrlcto exit")
           test()
       ```
   
   * Paste the **Primary Connection String** of the IoT device copied eariler in the `<Your-Primary-Connection-String>` field. 
     Then it would look something like this, 
     ##### Example
     ```
       # Primary Connection String
       CONNECTION_STRING = "HostName=<host-name>.azure-devices.net;DeviceID=<device-id>;SharedAccessKey=.....
     ```
   * Save **ProximityAlert_D2C.py**.

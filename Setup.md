## Requirements
Hardware and Software tools required for this setup are listed below.
1. Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+
2. Ultrasonic Distance Sensor Module (HC-SR04)
3. Resistors - 1 x 560 Ω and 1 x 800 Ω
4. Microsoft Azure subscription
5. Azure CLI 

## Architecture
###Add ultrasonic sensor###

## Setup
## Setting up Raspberry Pi

* #### Before you get started
  For this setup you need a preconfigured Raspberry Pi with an OS (of your choice) and Python 3 installed. 
  > __*Note*__: This setup was tested with _**Raspberry Pi OS (Raspbian)**_ which has Python 3 pre-installed.

* #### Making the connections
   An HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor Module is used to sense the presence of a vehicle in its proximity. Construct the circuit as shown below.

   ###Explain gpio setup###
  
* #### Inside the Pi
   * Now, after the connections are done, power up your Raspberry Pi. 
   * Open a Terminal and create a new directory `Proximity-Alert`
   * Next, We have to install an Azure IoT Package. Inside the newly created directory, run the following command.  
     `sudo pip3 install azure-iot-device`
   * Create a Python file **ProximityAlert_D2C.py** and paste in the following code to setup a Device to Cloud connection. *[How does this code work?](README.md#How-it-works)*
     > This code reads input from the Ultrasonic sensor module through GPIO Pins, then forms a connection between Raspberry Pi and Azure IoT Hub and transmits the recieved input to Azure.
